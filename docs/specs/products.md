# Products

## Overview

Products are the goods offered for sale in the Mercado catalog. A product carries identity (name, SKU, URL slug), classification (category, tags), pricing in a single currency (with an optional compare-at price for promotions), physical attributes, and a lifecycle status that decides whether customers can see it. The catalog is exposed both as a management API for other services and tools, and as a customer-facing storefront: a paginated grid of active products and a detail page addressed by slug.

This specification covers the product entity, its lifecycle, the management surface (create, read, update, delete, list), and the storefront surfaces that render it. Keyword search over the catalog is owned by `product-search.md`. The line-item snapshots that carts and orders take of a product — and the fact that those snapshots outlive changes to the product — are owned by `cart.md` and `orders.md`. Authentication of the management surface is owned by `auth.md` and `internal-authentication.md`.

This document states the required external contract; where the running system diverges from a stated requirement, the system is at fault, not this document.

## Goals and Non-Goals

### Goals

- Define the product entity and its observable field contract
- Define the three-status lifecycle and which statuses are customer-visible
- Define the management surface: create, read by id and by slug, update, delete, list with filtering and pagination
- Define the storefront catalog and product detail surfaces, including their empty, loading, and not-found states
- Define the uniqueness, precision, and validation limits the catalog enforces

### Non-Goals

- Keyword search over the catalog (`product-search.md`)
- Inventory management — stock levels, warehouses, stock movements
- Product variants (size, color, material) and product bundles or kits
- Media galleries — a product carries at most one image reference
- Product reviews and ratings
- Soft delete and audit history for products
- Bulk import and export

## Functional Requirements

### FR-1: Product Identity

- A product SHALL carry a system-generated identifier, a `name`, a globally unique `sku`, a globally unique URL-friendly `slug`, a `currency`, and a `price`.
- The system SHALL generate the `slug` from the product name at creation time.
- A product MAY carry a `description`, a `shortDescription`, a `category`, `tags`, an `imageUrl`, a `compareAtPrice`, a `costPrice`, and the physical attributes `weight`, `width`, `height`, and `length`.
- A product SHALL carry `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamps, both system-assigned.

### FR-2: Product Lifecycle

- A product SHALL carry a `status` of `draft`, `active`, or `archived` (LIM-3).
- A newly created product SHALL default to `draft`.
- Only an `active` product SHALL be visible on the storefront (FR-7, FR-8, LIM-6); `draft` and `archived` products SHALL be reachable only through the management surface.
- Archiving SHALL remove a product from the storefront while retaining it in the system.

### FR-3: Product Creation

- The system SHALL accept product creation via `POST /api/products`.
- Creation SHALL require `name`, `sku`, `price`, and `currency`; every other field SHALL be optional.
- Creation SHALL assign the identifier, slug, timestamps, and default status, and SHALL return the complete product including those generated values.
- Creation SHALL be rejected when the supplied `sku` or the generated `slug` collides with an existing product (LIM-1).

### FR-4: Product Retrieval

- The system SHALL expose `GET /api/products/:id` and `GET /api/products/by-slug/:slug`, each returning the complete product.
- Both retrieval paths SHALL reach a product in any status; storefront visibility is a property of the surface (FR-7, FR-8), not of retrieval.

### FR-5: Product Update

- The system SHALL accept partial updates via `PATCH /api/products/:id`; a field absent from the request SHALL retain its current value.
- An update SHALL validate supplied fields before persisting and SHALL refresh `updatedAt`.
- An update SHALL return the complete product with all current values.

### FR-6: Product Deletion and Listing

- The system SHALL accept `DELETE /api/products/:id` as a permanent removal, returning a success acknowledgement carrying the deleted product's identifier.
- The system SHALL expose `GET /api/products`, filterable by `status` and by `category` (both exact match), ordered by creation date with the newest first.
- Listing SHALL be paginated (LIM-2) and the response SHALL carry the total count of matching products alongside the current page, page size, and total page count.

### FR-7: Storefront Catalog

- The storefront catalog SHALL display only `active` products, paginated, in a responsive grid of equal-size cards.
- Each card SHALL display the product's name, price, image, and short description, and SHALL navigate to that product's detail page when activated.
- A product with no image SHALL display a generic placeholder image in its place.
- A product with a `compareAtPrice` SHALL display that price struck through alongside the current price.
- A card SHALL truncate the product name and short description with an ellipsis rather than overflow its bounds.
- The catalog SHALL display a loading indicator while products are being retrieved, and an empty-state message when no active product exists.
- The catalog SHALL display pagination controls below the grid when more than one page of results exists, and SHALL make the current page number and total page count visible.

### FR-8: Product Detail Surface

- The product detail surface SHALL be addressed by product slug at `/products/:slug` and SHALL resolve the product by that slug.
- The surface SHALL display the product image (or the placeholder), name, untruncated description, price with the struck-through compare-at price where present, and the category and tags where present.
- The surface SHALL display a loading indicator while the product is being retrieved and an error state when no product matches the slug.
- The surface SHALL offer a back control that returns the customer to the previously viewed page.

## Technical Requirements (System Limits)

These are binding limits on observable behavior, each verifiable from outside. The parenthetical notes point to where each is realized.

- **LIM-1 — Unique SKU and slug.** No two products share a `sku`, and no two share a `slug`; a create or update that would collide is rejected as a conflict. (FR-3, FR-5)
- **LIM-2 — Page size bounds.** Catalog page size is an integer in the range 1–100 inclusive, defaulting to 20; the page number starts at 1 and defaults to 1. A value outside those bounds is rejected. (FR-6, FR-7)
- **LIM-3 — Closed status vocabulary.** A product's `status` is one of `draft`, `active`, `archived`; any other value is rejected. (FR-2)
- **LIM-4 — Monetary and measurement precision.** `price`, `compareAtPrice`, `costPrice`, `weight`, `width`, `height`, and `length` each carry exactly two decimal places. Weight is expressed in grams and the three dimensions in centimeters. (FR-1)
- **LIM-5 — Required fields.** A product always has a `name`, `sku`, `slug`, `currency`, and `price`; none of them may be cleared by an update. (FR-1, FR-3, FR-5)
- **LIM-6 — Storefront visibility.** No `draft` or `archived` product appears on any storefront surface, in any listing, at any page. (FR-2, FR-7)
- **LIM-7 — Cost price is not public.** `costPrice` is never rendered on a storefront surface. (Security)

## Constraints (Externally Imposed)

- **CON-1 — ISO 4217 currency codes.** A product's `currency` is an ISO 4217 code; the vocabulary is defined by that standard, not by this feature. (FR-1)
- **CON-2 — Line-item snapshots.** Carts and orders capture a product's name, SKU, image, and price at the moment an item is added and do not track later product edits; those snapshot semantics are owned by `cart.md` and `orders.md`. (FR-5)
- **CON-3 — Search ownership.** Keyword matching, ranking, and the search surface are owned by `product-search.md`; this feature owns only the fields search reads and the `active`-only visibility rule it honors. (FR-7, LIM-6)

## Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Response |
|---|---|
| Create or update a product with a missing required field or an invalid value | HTTP 400 — validation error |
| Create a product with a `sku` already in use, or whose generated `slug` collides | HTTP 409 — conflict |
| Retrieve, update, or delete a product that does not exist | HTTP 404 — product not found |
| List products with a page size outside 1–100, or a page number below 1 | HTTP 400 — validation error |
| Request a `status` outside `draft` / `active` / `archived` | HTTP 400 — validation error |
| Open a detail surface for a slug that matches no product | Error state on the surface; no product data rendered |
| Render a product that carries no image | The generic placeholder image is displayed in its place |
| Unexpected failure on any product route | HTTP 500 — internal server error |

## Security Considerations

- `costPrice` SHALL be withheld from every storefront surface, so the catalog does not disclose acquisition cost or margin to customers (LIM-7).
- `draft` and `archived` products SHALL be unreachable from the storefront, so unreleased and withdrawn products are not exposed ahead of or beyond their intended availability (LIM-6).
- Product input SHALL be validated at the API boundary before persistence, so malformed values never reach storage (FR-3, FR-5).
